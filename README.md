* After game is won or lost, player can enter their name into the leaderboard.
* After name input, player name and score is sent to database, then leaderboard refreshes with current top 5 scores.

## Future Plans
I plan on implementing 3 new features to the game.
* First, I will create new levels.
* Second, players will need to collect all the pellets in order to get to the next level.
* Third, change score system to account for time instead of points.
