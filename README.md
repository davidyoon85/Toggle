## Controls
* Press AWD or Spacebar to move.
* Press M to mute the music.
* Press Enter to toggle hero color.
* On the game won or game loss screen, click to restart game.

## Features
* Player must reach the power pellet in order to go on to the next level.
* Collecting pellets along the way will increase your score.
* Player can toggle their hero color, to choose from: yellow, red, pink or blue.

## Future Plans
I plan on implementing 3 new features to the game.
* First, I will create new levels.
* Second, players will need to collect all the pellets in order to get to the next level.
* Third, change score system to account for time instead of points.
